## Installation
To get started, clone this repository *recursively*
``` bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/HTDerekLiu/intrinsic-simplification.git
```
so that you will also clone our dependencies, [libigl](https://libigl.github.io/) and [polycope](https://github.com/nmwsharp/polyscope). On all platforms, we assume you have installed cmake and a modern c++ compiler on Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows.

## Layout
The main folder contains separate examples that demonstrate some core functionalities and typical usage of our code. All of them have a similar directory and file layout:
```
cmake/
  CMakeLists.txt
README.md
main.cpp
```
+ [`00_coarsening/`](00_coarsening/): a minimal example to demonstrate how to use our intrinsic simplification.
+ [`01_prolongation_scalar/`](01_prolongation_scalar/): constructs a prolongation operator for scalar functions (Section 7.2), alongside a Laplace matrix and mass matrix on the simplified mesh.
+ [`02_mixture_quantities/`](02_mixture_quantities/): shows how our method can mix and match different quantites for coarsening (Fig. 11)
+ [`03_visualization/`](03_visualization/): shows how to visualize the intrinsic triangles sitting atop the original fine mesh (Fig. 15)

And they share a common `src` folder for source code and a `meshes` folder for input meshes.

## Compilation
We provide compilation guide for each example in its corresponding folder. In general, one should be able to compile our code with the common cmake/make routine, such as
``` bash
cd 00_coarsening
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
```
and then run
``` bash
./main
```
